javaScriptLint.vim
==================

This is a port of the [javaScriptLint.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2578) plugin.  Instead of running automatically when saving, it is run by calling the `JavaScriptLint` command.

[JavaScript Lint](http://www.javascriptlint.com/download.htm) must be installed and the `jsl` command must be in your path.

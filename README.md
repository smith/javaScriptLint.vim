javaScriptLint.vim
==================

This is a port of the javaScriptLint.vim[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2578] plugin.

Instead of running automatically when saving, it is run by calling the `JavaScri
ptLint` command. It can be used with a range as well.

JavaScript Lint[http://www.javascriptlint.com/download.htm] must be installed an
d the `jsl` command must be in your path.
